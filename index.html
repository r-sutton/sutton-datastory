        <h3>My Data Story</h3>
<p>
  This is where I'm going to talk about my data collection and what I learned about my use of different apps to talk to various people in my life!! It's kind of an overview section and a brief description about what exactly I monitored for our very first project and how that has translated into my everyday use of apps and social media to connect with friends and coworkers. Woooooooo!</p>

      <h4>Facebook</h4>
  This is where I'll be talking about the different interactions I had on Facebook during the week I was collecting data and how that translates to how I normally use Facebook and the messenger app to communicate with others. I'll also talk about how I mainly use it to communicate with people I know professionally. WOOO

      <h4>Snapchat</h4>
  This is where I'll be talking about the different interactions I had on Snapchat during the week I was collecting data and how that translates to how I normally use Snapchat to communicate with others. I'll also talk about how I mainly use it to communicate with my friends and that I only use it to have fun/interesting conversations — aka never serious ones. WOOOO!

  <h4>GroupMe</h4>
  This is where I'll be talking about the different interactions I had on GroupMe during the week I was collecting data and how that translates to how I normally use GroupeMe to communicate with others. I'll also talk about how I mainly use it to communicate with people I know professionally and for extracurriculars — aka not really that much with just normal friends. WOOO!
