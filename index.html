      <h1>SOCIAL MEDIA APP USAGE</h1>
      <p>
        At the beginning of the semester, I was able to track my data usage on four different apps: <b>Facebook, Snapchat, GroupMe, and Twitter.</b> I decided on these four because they were the apps I utilized the most often to communicate with my friends and colleagues. On this webpage, you'll find information and interpretations of my data collection. Enjoy!

        <h2>Introduction to My Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
         Through this data collection I was able to discover which apps I used on a more professional basis and which I used on a informal level. It was interesting to track my various interactions with people and how I used apps versus texting to get in contact with them.
         </p>
         <p>
           From there, this semester, I created a data visualization of my data (shown on the right). This visual clearly depicts the relationships of the people I talked to on each app I tracked data on. The "How To Read It" section is utilized as a legend to help viewers understand the different attributes I used to represent my relationship with the reciever, why I responded, and the topic of the conversation. <b>Click the image to view a larger version.</b>

      <h3>Facebook</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout the week, I sent the most messages on Facebook. I work for the Collegiate Times, Virginia Tech's newspaper, and we use Facebook to communicate with all of the sections when we edit articles. Due to this, my interactions were all more professional than personal. Although there were occassional messages sent to people on an informal level (to friends) a vast majority were work-related.

      </div>
      <h3>Snapchat</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout the week I solely used Snapchat to communicate with my friends. It was one of the more informal apps, and all of my conversations were about funny or random things â€” never really anything serious. I never spoke to someone I knew only on a professional level through Snapchat, in fact, I don't even have any of them added on my Snapchat.

      </div>
      <h3>GroupMe</h3>
      <p>
        GroupMe was a bit of a mix, but, like Facebook, was used mostly for professional communication. I am a Hokie Undergraduate Group Leader for the Department of Communication and a Features Editor for Her Campus, both of which utilize GroupMe to communicate. Also, all of my large group messages for my sorority, Chi Omega, are on the GroupMe app. The relationship I have with most of the people is either through work or extra-curriculars.

      </div>
      <h3>Twitter</h3>
      <p>
        Twitter, like Snapchat, was used only for messaging friends. Throughout the week, I discovered that I use Twitter a lot less than I thought I did, which surprised me. However, I figured that the only people I'd be communicating with on the app were my friends because it's a very informal form of communication, whereas Facebook and GroupMe can be professional if used in the right context.

          This video was based around my data collection. I found that a lot of my data was split between personal and professional relationships. This made me question the concept of a private versus personal life on the internet, and how using different apps to connect with certain types of people could result in potential employers finding personal profiles instead of professional ones through app linking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many social media apps allow you to link your apps together (such as Instagram and Facebook to post simultaneously and using Facebook log-ins on other apps), which can be convenient, but also puts users at risk of anyone they're connected with on professional-use apps finding their profiles (and potentially following/friending them) on their personal-use apps. For me, this would be someone on my Facebook or GroupMe I know professionally finding my Twitter or Snapchat through my other logins.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the video, I discuss the difference between personal and professional uses for social media, and how the need for privacy on all apps is vital to all people who utilize social media sites.
